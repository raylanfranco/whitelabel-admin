## 🎯 60-Second Demo Flow (Practice This)

### Part 1: Open Chat (5 seconds)
1. Click chat bubble
2. **Say**: "Watch this smooth animation..."
3. Chat window slides up
4. Bot greets: "Hi! Looking for [industry]? I can get you a quote in 30 seconds."

### Part 2: Start Conversation (5 seconds)
1. Type: "Yes"
2. **Say**: "The bot uses natural conversation - no forms, just chatting."
3. Bot asks for name

### Part 3: Collect Info (25 seconds)
1. Fill in: Name → "John Doe"
2. Bot asks for phone → Fill in: "(555) 123-4567"
3. Bot asks for email → Fill in: "john@example.com"
4. Bot asks for service → Fill in: "General pest control"
5. Bot asks for zip → Fill in: "12345"
6. **Say while filling**: "See how it's conversational? This feels natural, not like a form."

### Part 4: Lead Captured (10 seconds)
1. Bot confirms: "Perfect! [Business] will text you within 15 minutes."
2. **Say**: "Now watch this - that lead just appeared in their admin panel."
3. **Switch to Tab 2** (admin panel)
4. **Point to new lead** appearing at top of list
5. **Say**: "See that? That's a real lead, captured 24/7. Never miss a customer."

### Part 5: Close (15 seconds)
1. **Say**: "Most of our clients add this for $99/mo after the $497 setup."
2. **Pause** - let them process
3. **Say**: "This chatbot pays for itself in the first week. Want to get you set up?"
4. **Wait for response**

## 🗣️ Key Phrases to Memorize

### Opening
> "So most of our clients add this AI chatbot for $99/mo. It captures leads 24/7 - never miss a customer. Watch this..."

### During Demo
> "See how smooth that animation is? That's a $5k product."
> "The bot adapts to their website colors automatically - zero configuration."
> "It works on mobile too - 60% of traffic is mobile."

### Showing Admin Panel
> "Now watch this - that lead just appeared in their dashboard. Real-time. Works 24/7."

### Closing
> "This chatbot pays for itself in the first week. Most of our [industry] clients are at this tier. Want to get you set up?"

## 🚫 Things to AVOID

### ❌ Don't Say
- "It's still in beta" (even if true)
- "We're working on adding features" (implies incomplete)
- "It's pretty basic right now" (undercuts $99/mo)
- Technical jargon (React, API, Strapi, etc.)

### ✅ Instead Say
- "This is our premium chatbot system"
- "This is what our clients use"
- "It's fully automated - works 24/7"
- Focus on RESULTS, not tech

## 📊 Demo Metrics (Track These)

- **Demo Length**: Target 60-90 seconds total
- **Reaction Time**: Measure time until they say "wow" or similar
- **Closing Attempt**: Did you ask for the deposit?
- **Objection Handling**: What did they object to?

## 🔥 Objection Handling

### "That seems expensive"
**Response**: "I understand. But think about it - if you miss 3 calls a day because you're on a job, that's 90 missed opportunities a month. Even at a 20% close rate, that's 18 lost jobs. At $300 per job average, that's $5,400/month in lost revenue. This chatbot pays for itself in the first week."

### "We don't get many website visitors"
**Response**: "That's exactly why this matters. Every visitor counts. This captures every single one - even at 2am when you're sleeping. One lead per week at $99/mo is a no-brainer."

### "I'll think about it"
**Response**: "Totally understand. Quick question - are you thinking about the $497 setup, or the $99/mo ongoing? Because I can hold a spot for you at the early adopter rate, but we're raising prices to $2,497 next month. I'd hate for you to miss out."

## ✅ Success Indicators

You're doing it right if:
- ✅ They say "wow" or "that's cool" during demo
- ✅ They ask "how much?" before you mention price
- ✅ They want to see it again
- ✅ They mention other businesses that could use it

## 🎯 Practice Schedule

### Tonight (Before Demo)
- [ ] Run through demo 10 times
- [ ] Time yourself - should be 60-90 seconds
- [ ] Practice objection handling out loud
- [ ] Record yourself (optional) to hear how you sound

### Day of Demo
- [ ] Test everything 30 minutes before call
- [ ] Have demo tabs ready
- [ ] Have Stripe link ready to send
- [ ] Practice opening line 3x before call

## 💰 The Goal

**One demo = One deposit**

If you demo this 20 times and close 5, that's:
- 5 deposits × $250 = **$1,250 cash**
- 5 clients × $99/mo = **$495 MRR**

**One week of demos = $10k cash + $2k MRR**

---

## 🚀 Final Reminder

**You're not selling a chatbot. You're selling a money-printing machine.**

The chatbot:
- Works 24/7 (never sleeps)
- Captures every lead (never misses)
- Looks premium (justifies $2,497)
- Shows results immediately (builds trust)

**Practice 10x. Close every demo. Get those deposits.**
